## highlight
- surround yourself with good people because, "we are the average of our circle of friends" - david park

## wins
meaningful achievements (stats)/the things you probably don't want to do

sent request to one vendor for refund for broken goods. my goal is 4 a week.
reviewed a an app (ultradox)



## thoughts
- ranks for tasks, projects, posts, etc
- write about automating workflows (create and share your use cases) with tools like zapier, ifttt, ultradox, etc as it pertains to business (maybe narrow it down to sales optics)
- highlight which is voted on on top of page
  - research and poll for best time to replace
  - awards for winners
  - micro-interactions!
- are publicizing jokes okay?
- why chronological framework?  maybe it's part of your journey, maybe it's not
- integrations (zapier, ifttt, rescuetime, calendar, phone, etc...)
- [ ] develop list of potential articles

wandering minds of the kids
by michael jackson







what are you grateful for today?
if you only do one thing, do this
some folks like the mornings, others prefer to relfect on their day later.     			/////just set yourself a very attainable goal, weekly, bi-weekly, even once a month
was able to see and spend time with an old friend, is very dear me and somehow manages to  push my buttons and felt overwhlemed.
achieving many of my micro-goals has vbeen up, but whyyy?

check-the-list chores  made me feel better, however, didn't make


one good thing/bad thing for the day
what do you think?

schedule planning for goals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, five-year)
schedule timeline for delivering results (include late fees)

comment boxes? email? phone? survey?
