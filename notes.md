# My online notepad
In efforts to help me better communicate and serve the community I'll be publishing my thoughts, ideas, and notes--with an end goal of creating a structured wiki page to share my insights and inspirations for my favorite topics.

Hopefully exploring my thought process may help some of you refine your own!

# Top of mind

1. __Focus on the message__
2. Gain experience >> take action *(after all, i've heard that __action__ is the 6-letter word for success)*
3. KISS = *Keep It Simple Silly*
